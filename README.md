# git-experimenting

Repository for experimenting with git features

## .git Size History

- 92K ./.git (original)
- 684K ./.git (after committing to master a 572K jpg)
- 984K ./.git (after committing+pushing a 304K jpg to a seperate branch)
- 984K ./.git (after deleting that separate branch). 660K ./.git after cloning
  the repository after the branch was deleted from github. Does this mean that
  git clone will not include any history from deleted branches?
